# MateMonkey light

A lightweight and responsive frontend alternative for matemonkey.com

## More Info
- Based on the Mate Monkey API (https://github.com/MateMonkey/api), this is just a try with a simpler and more repsonsive user interface. It is also running a fullscreen Android and iOS Webapplication, if added as an icon to the homescreen.
- By now only the GET functionality is implemented. Maybe a change interface will also be implemented.

## More to come
- POST/PUT interface for changes
- Smarter bounding box calculation.
- More (mobile) optimations
- Nice Leaflet icons/displaying
- Layout / UX changes

## Misc
The original project can be found under https://github.com/MateMonkey and is made by Maximilian GÃ¼ntner.
